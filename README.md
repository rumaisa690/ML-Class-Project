# ML-Class-Project
A repository for the github page my project group and I created for our final report on our semester long Machine Learning Project

Link to our final report: https://github.gatech.edu/pages/hshahzad6/ml_proj.github.io/final_report.html

We based our ML project on finetuning ML models to accurately distinguish between hazardous and non-hazardous asteroids.
We used data collected from the NASA API, with our dataset containing around 40 different asteroid classifying features. By analyzing these features, we aimed to accurately discern which asteroids should be considered hazardous, contributing to the management of potential cosmic threats. 

We implemented feature selection on our dataset using Lasso Regression and classification using the Random Forest model and Logistic Regression as well as visualizing quantitative metrics like Logarithmic Loss, AUC-ROC, and F1 Score.

** My Contribution **
I personally worked on training and fine-tuning the two ML models of Random Forest and Logistic Regression as well as using the Logarithmic Loss and AUC-ROC algorithms on our results.
If you scroll down to the bottom of the GitHub Page there is a link to our Colab notebook with our code, I coded sections 1, 3, 4, 5.
